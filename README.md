### 🙆‍♀️ Hi, I'm Yuqi Chen, a second-year PhD student at the University of Vermont. Working with Professor Safwan, my research explores the field of computer vision. My current work is centered on geolocalization, and I'm also interested in vision-language models and generative learning. I'm excited to share my progress and learn from the community here.
